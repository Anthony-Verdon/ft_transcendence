# Ft_transcendence

## Make a pong game, but with some extras

This project is the last one of the 42 common core. The goal is to create a single page application, with some features. For that, I was with my friend Th√©o Guerin (login 42 : tguerin, Github account : https://github.com/TheoGuerin64) and Unai Layus (login 42 : ulayus, Github account : https://github.com/0x35c). You will find the subject of the project into the repository. My grade : 100/100

## What did we used

In the subject, we must have a framework of your choice for the front, NestJS for the back and a PostgreSQL database. For the front, we chose VueJS. We also used ThreeJS which is a 3D Library for the game, and Bulma which is a CSS Library. Finally, we had a container for PGAdmin to see the database. 

## How to use it 

1. Install Docker `https://docs.docker.com`
2. Install Docker Compose `https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/`
3. Clone it `git clone git@github.com:AnthonyVerdon-42Projects/ft_transcendence.git`.
